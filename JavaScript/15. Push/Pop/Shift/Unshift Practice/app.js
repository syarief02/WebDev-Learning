// Push/Pop/Shift/Unshift Practice
// I've provided you with an array called planets. Unfortunately, I'm an idiot who doesn't know much about our solar system and I made some mistakes.  Please help me fix the planets array!  Using the array methods we just learned...

// Remove the first element, "The Moon", from the planets array.  The moon is not a planet!

// Add in "Saturn" at the very end of the planets array

// Add "Mercury" as the first element in the planets array.

// At the end of your hard work, planets should look like this: ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"]

// (This one is super easy to cheat on.  Please use the array methods we just covered, rather than simply changing the values in planets directly)

const planets = ["The Moon", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter"]; //DO NOT TOUCH THIS LINE!

// YOUR CODE GOES BELOW THIS LINE:

planets.shift();
planets.push("Saturn");
planets.unshift("Mercury");

console.log(planets);
