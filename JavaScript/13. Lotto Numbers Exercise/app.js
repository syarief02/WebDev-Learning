// Lotto Numbers Exercise
// Let's get some practice creating arrays. Please define a variable called lottoNumbers and set it equal to an array containing any 6 numbers.  It's simple, but we've got to start somewhere!

// Define lottoNumbers below:
let lottoNumbers= [1,2,3,4,5,6];
console.log(lottoNumbers);
