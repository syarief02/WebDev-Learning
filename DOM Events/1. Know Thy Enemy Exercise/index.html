<!-- Know Thy Enemy Exercise
In this exercise, I'm asking you to write some inline event handlers WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING I RECOMMEND, but hopefully it will illustrate to you just how annoying it can be. In index.html, you'll find an <h1> element and a <button>.  Please add two inline click handlers directly in the html:

When the h1 is clicked, you should print*  "boo"

When the button is clicked, you should print "clicked"

* "print" = console.log('something here'); -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <title>Inline Events</title>
    <!--LEAVE THESE LINES ALONE, PLEASE! THEY MAKE THE LIVE PREVIEW WORK!-->
    <script src="node_modules/babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

</head>

<body>
    <h1 onclick="console.log('boo')">Inline Events Suck...</h1>
    <button onclick="console.log('clicked');" id="btn">Click Me</button>
</body>
