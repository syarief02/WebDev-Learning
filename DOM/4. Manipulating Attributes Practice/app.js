// Manipulating Attributes Practice
// Let's get some practice working with DOM element attributes. I've provided you with some very basic markup.  Please select the image element and:

// change its source to this url: https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg

// change its alt text to be "chicken"

// The url you need: 'https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg'

const image = document.querySelector("img");

image.src = "https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg";
image.alt = "chicken"
