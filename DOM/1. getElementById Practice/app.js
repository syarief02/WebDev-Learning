// getElementById Practice
// Let's get some practice using getElementById. I've provided a little bit of markup for you (please don't change it!)  Your goal is to write code in app.js to select the following elements using getElementById:

// Select the image element by its id and save it to a variable called image

// Select the h1 by its id and save it to a variable called heading

// Note: You may need to reset the code before attempting this exercise

// Write your code in here:

const image = document.getElementById("unicorn");
const heading = document.getElementById("mainheading");
